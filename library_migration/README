dump the mysql database
load it into my mysql server
use sqlfairy to take its schema and load it into a postgres db
use a rails project with convert.rake and database.yml to load it into the postgres db
dump the postgres database (schema and all), and load it into an fgdb database
use library_migration/TABLES to load fgdb's tables
dump the fgdb library specific tables (without schema), and load it on the production db (hope it works, may need to disable triggers..)
