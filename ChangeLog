  * no javascript/dhtml stylesheets on the skedjul when in readonly mode

    breaking the production database...
  * when the cashier code is not entered, don't allow the x/e links for
    line items to be clicked

  * add the scripts that sync the staffsched to freegeek.org to git

    releasing
  * remove extra <td> in recycling's gizmo events line item
  * use proper ajax for the cashier code checking, add loading indicator
  * allow spaces in the RAILS_ROOT...*sigh*
  * scramble some of the newer tables when making devel data
  * don't use a gzipped version for the devel data...look for it
    uncompressed.
  * download lzma devel data

  * always download the data when loading, but only if there's a new
    version
  * move the svn post-commit hook for the devel data from svn to git
  * export all versions of devel data
  * script to create devel data
  * updated devel data
