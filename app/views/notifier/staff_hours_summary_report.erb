Hello Scheduler(s),

Here's a list of all of the people who were scheduled to work on a
certain day within the current pay period but didn't log their hours:
<% @myworkers.each do |w| -%>
 <%= w.name %> (<%= w.email %>)
<% w.dates.each do |x| -%>
  <%= x %>
<% end -%>
<% end -%>

Sincerely,
The database
