Hello Scheduler(s),

Here's a list of all of the people who were scheduled to work on a
certain day within the current pay period but didn't log their hours:
<% a = [] -%>
<% @myworkers.each do |w| -%>
 <%= w.name %> (<%= w.email %>)
<% w.dates.each do |x| -%>
  <%= a << x; x %><%# ": " + url_for(:host => "data", :controller => "work_shifts", :action => "list", :filter_criteria => {:limit_to_worker => 1, :worker_id => w.worker_id, :end_date => x, :start_date => x, :presentation_mode => "Edit"}, :escape => false) %>
<% end -%>
<% end -%>

To see the schedule for whole days:
<% a.sort.uniq.each do |x| -%>
 <%= x %>: <%= url_for(:host => "data", :controller => "work_shifts", :action => "list", :filter_criteria => {:end_date => x, :start_date => x, :presentation_mode => "Edit"}, :escape => false) %>
<% end -%>

Sincerely,
The database
