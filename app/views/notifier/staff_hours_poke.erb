Hello <%= @myworker.name %>,

According to the database, you were scheduled to work on the following
days but didn't log any hours:
<% @myworker.dates.each do |x| -%>
 <%= x %>
<% end -%>

If you are at Free Geek, you can use the following links to log your
hours for these days:
<% @myworker.dates.each do |x| -%>
 <%= url_for(:host => "data", :controller => "worked_shifts", :action => "edit", :worked_shift => {:worker_id => @myworker.worker_id, :date_performed => x}, :escape => false) %>
<% end -%>

Please go to the above links and log your hours.

If you didn't really work on that day, send an email
to <%= Default["scheduler_reports_to"] %>.

If you can't make it in to log your hours, send an email to
<%= Default["scheduler_reports_to"] %> with how many hours you
worked in each place on each day.

Sincerely,
The database
